            <h2>About Bharat ki Bachat</h2>
            <p class="lead">In the heart of India’s bustling economy lies a silent revolution, one that is poised to redefine the financial landscape of a nation on the brink of a digital renaissance. This revolution is not led by the stalwarts of industry or the architects of policy, but by the very people it seeks to empower—the citizens of India. It is here that we begin our story, with the inception of Project Bharat ki Bachat.</p>
    
            <div class="vision">
                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>Project Bharat ki Bachat was born out of a simple yet profound realization: financial literacy is not a privilege but a necessity. In a country where the disparity between the haves and the have-nots is stark, the project envisions a future where every individual, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, has the tools and knowledge to make informed financial decisions.</p>

                <p>The road to financial empowerment is fraught with challenges. The rapid digitization of financial services, while a boon in many respects, has also given rise to a new breed of threats—fintech payment frauds. These frauds prey on the uninformed and the unprepared, siphoning away hard-earned money and eroding trust in digital transactions.</p>
